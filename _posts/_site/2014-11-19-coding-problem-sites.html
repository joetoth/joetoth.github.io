<p>I’ve been checking out a bunch of sites where you can improve your knowledge of
algorithms and puzzle solving. In no particular order here are some:</p>

<p><a href="http://hackerrank.com">Hackerrank.com</a> Supports pretty much every major language.
Lots of challenges. Coding in the browser is nice as it supports vim and emacs,
which isn’t so bad if you don’t have to write a bunch of tests and not that many
lines of code =)
<a href="http://coderbyte.com">Coderbyte.com</a> Supports Javascript, Python, Ruby, PHP, C++ and Java. The easy and medium challenges are suited for freshmen/sophomores.
<a href="http://interviewcake.com">Interviewcake.com</a> Some free questions, then it’s paid. This isn’t a challenges site, but asks questions and gives hints as you try and get the answer. Could be useful for people starting out.</p>
