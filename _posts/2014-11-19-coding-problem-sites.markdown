I've been checking out a bunch of sites where you can improve your knowledge of
algorithms and puzzle solving. In no particular order here are some:

[Topcoder.com][topcoder] The site that started it all. In all these years they
are still using a java applet as their coding environment. Whatever works.
People have even written plugins so you can code in vim locally and submit I
believe. This is a great site that has tons of problems. The only thing that
kind of stinks AFAIK is when you submit and answer and don't get a 100% of it
right it doesn't tell you what you missed. When you don't get feedback it's hard
to know what you have to practice. Topcoder supports C++, Java, C#, Visual
Basic, and Python.                   

[Codechef.com][codechef] This is another great site with tons of challenges. You
can submit code in all the popular languages. I think they are using GCC where
possible because they are using a very old 1.0 version of Go. I tried submitting
some code and it told me append wasn't a function!
Lots of problems and solutions. I think its more focused on getting right
answers than ensuring your code handles edge cases which is nice when you want
to explore/answer new problems quickly. 

[Hackerrank.com][hackerrank] Supports pretty much every major language.
Lots of challenges. Coding in the browser is nice as it supports vim and emacs,
which isn't so bad if you don't have to write a bunch of tests and not that many
lines of code =)

[Coderbyte.com][coderbyte] Supports Javascript, Python, Ruby, PHP, C++ and Java. The easy and medium challenges are suited for freshmen/sophomores.

[Interviewcake.com][cake] Some free questions, then it's paid. This isn't a challenges site, but asks questions and gives hints as you try and get the answer. Could be useful for people starting out.

As I was writing this post I found an equivalent one over at
[http://codecondo.com/coding-challenges/][codecondo] that included more sites. Check it out!
